- WHAT IS GOING ON UNDER THE HOOD?
1) Pure HTML/CSS for the layout of the website.
2) JavaScript (without any frameworks!) is used for all the interactive parts. 
3) The HTML elements that need to change in the DOM are targetted by using "querySelector" in combination with click events on the 
buttons by using "EventListeners".
4) "IF statements" are used to make sure to have the desired outcome depending on the client's input.
